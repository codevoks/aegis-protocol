# Aegis Protocol

**A risk-first, isolated-market, overcollateralized lending protocol on Solana.**

> **STATUS: PHASE 2 — STATE, PDAs AND CUSTODY PRIMITIVES. NO LENDING PROTOCOL LOGIC EXISTS.**
> Aegis is under construction. Phase 2 ships the `Protocol`, `Market` and `Position` account
> structs exactly as frozen in `account-model.md`; the `initialize_protocol`, `create_market` and
> `init_position` instructions; both custody vaults with the `Market` PDA as authority and
> Token-2022-aware sizing; and the positive Token-2022 extension allowlist. There is still no
> deposit, withdrawal, supply, borrow, repay, interest, oracle, or liquidation — those begin at
> Phases 3–6. See [`docs/project-status.md`](docs/project-status.md) for the authoritative state of
> every component.

## What Aegis is

Each Aegis market is an independent lending venue defined by exactly one collateral asset, one loan
asset, one oracle configuration, and one frozen risk parameter set. Lenders supply the loan asset and
earn utilization-driven interest. Borrowers escrow collateral — which is **never lent out** — and
borrow against it. Positions breaching their liquidation threshold are liquidated permissionlessly for
a bonus. Losses are contained inside the market that produced them, absorbed first by protocol fees
and only then socialized across that market's lenders.

The organizing principle is that **risk must be bounded, named, and localized** — in the account
model, in the economics, and in the failure modes.

## The three decisions that shape it

1. **Isolated two-asset markets, not a cross-collateral money market** ([ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-isolated-markets.md)).
   Distinct markets share no writable account, so they parallelize by construction, solvency is a
   bounded two-asset computation, and bad debt provably cannot cross markets.
2. **Collateral is escrowed and never lent** ([ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-collateral-escrow-and-vault-design.md)).
   This makes custody an exact, assertable identity and removes withdrawal-liquidity crunches
   entirely — at a deliberate cost in capital efficiency.
3. **Oracle failure is fail-closed for risk-increasing operations and fail-open for risk-reducing
   ones** ([ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-oracle-abstraction-no-mock-program.md)).
   Borrowing and liquidation stop when prices are untrustworthy; repaying, topping up collateral, and
   recognizing bad debt never do.

## Planned properties

- Everything runs **offline and free** — no RPC, no API key, no faucet, no paid service.
- Deterministic prices via **byte-exact Pyth account injection**, so tests exercise the real
  deserialization path and the production program contains **no mock oracle code**.
- **87 invariants**, nine of them asserted after every instruction by a stateful fuzzer, with mutation
  testing proving the fuzzer can actually falsify them.
- **32 threats** enumerated, each with a named test that must fail when its mitigation is removed.
- Every performance claim backed by committed before/after compute measurements.

## Planned stack

Anchor 1.x · Rust · SPL Token & Token-2022 · Pyth pull oracle ·
LiteSVM / Mollusk / Surfpool · `@solana/kit` v8 · Next.js.
Native Solana Rust and Pinocchio appear in scoped, benchmarked labs — not in production
([ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-native-pinocchio-as-labs.md)).

## Quickstart

**Right now (Phase 2):** `programs/aegis` implements `Protocol`, `Market`, and `Position` accounts;
`initialize_protocol`, `create_market`, and `init_position`; two custody vault token accounts per
market (SPL Token or Token-2022, sized correctly for whatever extensions are present, never
hardcoded to 165 bytes); and the Token-2022 positive extension allowlist with per-role enforcement
and freeze-authority acknowledgement. `create_market` performs no token transfers — this phase
proves custody *structure*, not lending behavior. There is still no deposit, withdrawal, supply,
borrow, repay, interest accrual, oracle, or liquidation, and no SDK/app yet.

```bash
make setup   # verify the pinned toolchain (Solana CLI, Anchor, Surfpool, Node) is installed
make build   # anchor build — compiles `programs/aegis` and generates its IDL
make test    # cargo test --workspace — offline, no network, no secrets (the load-bearing command)
make demo    # protocol init, an SPL market, a Token-2022 market, positions, a rejection table —
             # offline against an in-process LiteSVM (see docs/phases/phase-02-state.md "Demo")
```

`make fuzz`, `make bench`, and `make app` exist as stubs that name the phase that implements them
(10, 11, and 9 respectively) — they are not yet functional. The full lending/liquidation/bad-debt
demo scenario in [`docs/zero-cost-demo.md`](docs/zero-cost-demo.md) §5 ships in Phase 13, once those
instructions exist.

The exact install commands, pinned versions, and verification steps are recorded in
[`docs/phases/phase-01-foundation.md`](docs/phases/phase-01-foundation.md) §3 and
[`docs/ecosystem-research.md`](docs/ecosystem-research.md). Everything `.gitignore` excludes
(`target/`, `node_modules/`, `.anchor/`, local validator ledgers, build caches) is mechanically
regenerated by these commands — never hand-crafted, and never required to understand or review the
project.

## Security status

**Aegis is not audited and must not be deployed to mainnet with real user capital.**

The engineering rigor is real; the risk calibration is not. Specifically: risk parameters are
illustrative rather than researched, the oracle is single-source, there are no supply caps, and the
upgrade authority is an unmitigated total risk. See
[`docs/economic-model.md` §11](docs/economic-model.md) for the v1 simplifications and
[`docs/threat-model.md` §4](docs/threat-model.md) for the accepted residual risks — both are stated
plainly rather than buried.
